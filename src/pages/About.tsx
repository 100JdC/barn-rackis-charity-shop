              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Rackis for Barn is a platform designed specifically for students in Uppsala to exchange 
                second-hand items during move-ins and move-outs. We believe in creating a sustainable 
                cycle where useful items find new homes instead of being discarded.

                  that are still useful, donate them to us. We collect items like duvets, curtains, 
                  bikes, kitchen equipment, and much more.
