                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Rackis for Barn is a platform designed specifically for students in Uppsala to exchange 
                  second-hand items during move-ins and move-outs. We believe in creating a sustainable 
                  cycle where useful items find new homes instead of being discarded.

                  <p>
                    <strong>For Donors:</strong> When you're moving out, instead of throwing away items 
                    that are still useful, donate them to us. We collect items like duvets, curtains, 
                    bikes, kitchen equipment, and much more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>For Buyers:</strong> Moving into a new place in Uppsala? Browse our collection 
                    of second-hand items at fair prices. Everything you need to make your student housing 
                    feel like home.
